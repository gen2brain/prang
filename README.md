Prang is a rather destructive action game for android that puts you on a
shooting range with the objective to hit as many dummy targets as possible 
within 3 minutes. You control a gun which may either fire small or large 
grenades at dummy soldiers, jeeps and tanks. The gameplay is simple but
it is not that easy to get high scores. 

Prang is a fork of Barrage by Michael Speck (http://lgames.sf.net).
